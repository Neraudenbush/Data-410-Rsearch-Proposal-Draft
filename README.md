# Data-410-Rsearch-Proposal-Draft
Draft of the proposal for final research project in DATA 410

### Introduction 
One aspect of data science that interests me a lot is its cross over between sports. One of the fields I would really like to go into as a career is using data to model and predict to help professional baseball teams optimize their results. For this reason, I have elected to do my final research using Data from Major League Baseball (MLB). In 2015 the MLB introduced _Statcast_. 

Description of Statcast"
"Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking technology, capable of measuring previously unquantifiable aspects of the game. Set up in all 30 Major League ballparks, Statcast collects data using a series of high-resolution optical cameras along with radar equipment. The technology precisely tracks the location and movements of the ball and every player on the field, resulting in an unparalleled amount of information covering everything from the pitcher to the batter to baserunners and defensive players"

This allows for highly accurate data in all aspects of the sport. The dataset I have selected is Pitch data from 2021. I plan on using the information provided in the dataset to see how accuratly I can predict the outcome of a given pitch (hit, strike, ball, etc.).
